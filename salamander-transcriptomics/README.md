# üß¨ Salamander Transcriptomics
I started work on this project in August 2023 in the Biodiversity Discovery FRI
stream at the University of Texas at Austin. I learned Bash shell scripting
while working on this project, but I have some experience coding in Python from
the past.

Our goal is to determine the modes of natural selection operating on genes
involved in the sensory systems of cave- and surface-dwelling _Eurycea_
salamanders. We will do this by analyzing substitution rates in the transcripts
of these genes. 

Since this project is computational, I took the initiative to learn Bash
scripting and create programs to make our workflow faster and easier. The
programs I coded are simple. They are found in this repository. 

## üñ•Ô∏è blast
Used to create BLAST database and search for Pax6 transcripts.

## üñ•Ô∏è connecting-scripts
Used to find candidate transcripts for analysis.

## üñ•Ô∏è fasta-make
Used to make a FASTA file for the top BLAST output of every species.

## üñ•Ô∏è multi-fasta-make
Used to make a multi FASTA file for every BLAST output of a species.
